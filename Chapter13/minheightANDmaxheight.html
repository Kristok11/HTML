        invented by Harold Rhodes during the fifties and later manufactured in a number of models,

        amplified by electromagnetic pickups.

        The Wurlitzer electric piano is an electro-mechanical piano, 
        created by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company of Mississippi. 
        The Wurlitzer company itself never called the instrument an "electric piano", 
        instead inventing the phrase "Electronic Piano" and using this as a trademark throughout the production of the instrument. 
        It employs a piano-like keyboard with hammers that hit small metal tines, amplified by electromagnetic pickups.

          Various models were produced over the years, including the models I, II, L, C, D6, and E7.</p>
