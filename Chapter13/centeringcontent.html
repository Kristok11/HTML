        The Rhodes piano is an electro-mechanical piano, 
        invented by Harold Rhodes during the fifties and later manufactured in a number of models,
        first in collaboration with Fender and after 1965 by CBS. 
        It employs a piano-like keyboard with hammers that hit small metal tines, 
        amplified by electromagnetic pickups.
